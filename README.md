# Enze's Portfolio Page (WIP)

This is a personal portfolio project I started in December 2022. It is my first exposure with web development through HTML, CSS and React.js. It is still a work in progress and I am currently brushing up my skills before continuing this project. The page can be accessed here https://sohenze.vercel.app/.

## Folders

Currently, this repository is organised into 3 folders. `components`, `data` and `images`. 

### Components

The main bulk of the source code is stored here. There are 5 files for the 5 different sections of the webpage.

### Data

Personal data pertaining to the user are stored here as accessable variables to the source code in `components`.

### Images
Media files used in the webpage are stored here.

## Known Bugs/Areas to work on

1. Display is not fitted to the window screen size. Sections of the sidebar can be cut off.
2. Components do not scale according to window size.
