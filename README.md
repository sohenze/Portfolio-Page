# Enze's Portfolio Page

This is a personal portfolio project I started in December 2022. It is my first exposure to React.js and I am using this as a platform to learn React. 

## Folders

Currently, this repository is organised into 3 folders. `components`, `data` and `images`. 

### Components

The main bulk of the source code is stored here. There are 5 files for the 5 different sections of the webpage.

### Data

Personal data pertaining to the user are stored here as accessable variables to the source code in `components`.

### Images
Media files used in the webpage are stored here.

#### Known Bugs/Areas to work on

1. Display is not fitted to the window screen size. Sections of the sidebar can be cut off.
2. Components do not react to a window resize.
